<h2>Photography Website for Nadine van Zyl</h2>
<h3>Brief:</h3>
I had the pleasure to create a Website for Nadine van Zyl, a professional and very talented photographer. 
The website is according to her requirements and some examples she presented.

The website did not go live as the client eventually chose to continue with a wordpress template website. 

<h3>Additional Notes:</h3>
<ul><li>One of my first landing pages created with galleries and multiple sections.</li>
    <li>Not mobile friendly.</li>
</ul>
